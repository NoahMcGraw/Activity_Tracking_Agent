The screenshot displays a Python script labeled `screenshot.py`, designed to save screenshots to a specified folder. The function `save_screenshot(save_folder)` generates a file path using a timestamp and saves the screenshot. The script includes argument handling to check if a save folder is provided; if not, it prompts the user with the correct usage. Additionally, it creates the save folder if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
